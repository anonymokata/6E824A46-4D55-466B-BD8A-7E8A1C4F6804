# TDD-Roman-Numeral-Calculator
This project is intended to compile under Ubuntu 14.04, but should compile under most Posix operating systems.  Any commits should adhere to the C99 standard and must be accompanied by unit tests. Unit tests should be written using Check (https://libcheck.github.io/check/).

Internal representations of Roman Numerals will be in plain ASCII, following the recommendations in the latest Unicode standard availiable (currently 8.0.0 http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/ch22.pdf). There will be no support for Unicode code points outside the ASCII range.

Compilation is performed by typing "make", if you wish to run the test suite type "make test".
